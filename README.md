# MyConsoleRC
Console with implemented Find and Stat functions, also executes path commands, no cd or pwd or multiple pipe commands.</br>
There is no GUI and some communication channels may be redundant because the target of the project was using multiple processes and make them communicate through different ways: pipe, fifo, socketpair.
Project made for college subject Computer Networks (FII, year 2)
